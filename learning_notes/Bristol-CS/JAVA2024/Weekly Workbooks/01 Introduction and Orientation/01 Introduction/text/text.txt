Welcome to this first practical workbook for the Object Oriented Programming with Java unit.
The aim of these workbooks is to explore key theoretical concepts that underlie the unit and 
give you the opportunity to apply these in practical programming exercises. In the previous teaching block, you learnt to program in C (to varying degrees of success ;o). In this unit however, you will be using **Java** and as such the _organisation_ of your code _should_ be very different. There are a number of key concepts that are fundamental to **Object Oriented** code. These will be introduced in the lecture sessions to this unit - it is essential that you engage with these lecture sessions before attempting the practical exercises. In order to complete the workbooks, you will also need to make use of the material from each weeks briefing session. The slides for both the lecture and briefing sessions can be found on GitHub.

This first workbook is relatively simple and straightforward - the aim is to provide a gentle introduction to the unit, before we start to address more complex and sophisticated language concepts.
Where you see the blue "Slides" and "Video" buttons at the top of some of the sections in a workbook, 
you should view this material _before_ attempting the practical activities described in that section. 
Note that it is easier to 'clone' the GitHub repository and view the workbook materials locally on your own computer
(rather than trying to browse them online via the GitHub website).
