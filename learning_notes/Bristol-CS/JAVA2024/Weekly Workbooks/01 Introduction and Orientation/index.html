<h3 id="task-1-introduction">Task 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to this first practical workbook for the Object Oriented
Programming with Java unit. The aim of these workbooks is to explore key
theoretical concepts that underlie the unit and give you the opportunity
to apply these in practical programming exercises. In the previous
teaching block, you learnt to program in C (to varying degrees of
success ;o). In this unit however, you will be using
<strong>Java</strong> and as such the <em>organisation</em> of your code
<em>should</em> be very different. There are a number of key concepts
that are fundamental to <strong>Object Oriented</strong> code. These
will be introduced in the lecture sessions to this unit - it is
essential that you engage with these lecture sessions before attempting
the practical exercises. In order to complete the workbooks, you will
also need to make use of the material from each weeks briefing session.
The slides for both the lecture and briefing sessions can be found on
GitHub.</p>
<p>This first workbook is relatively simple and straightforward - the
aim is to provide a gentle introduction to the unit, before we start to
address more complex and sophisticated language concepts. Where you see
the blue “Slides” and “Video” buttons at the top of some of the sections
in a workbook, you should view this material <em>before</em> attempting
the practical activities described in that section. Note that it is
easier to ‘clone’ the GitHub repository and view the workbook materials
locally on your own computer (rather than trying to browse them online
via the GitHub website).</p>
<h1 id="section"></h1>
<h3 id="task-2-intellij-ide">Task 2: IntelliJ IDE</h3>
<p>Previously on this programme, the emphasis was on learning to
program. In this current teaching block, we will be focusing on the
skills required to turn you into a <em>developer</em>. Part of this
skillset is the ability to effectively use an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). In this unit, we will therefore be using the IntelliJ
IDE in order to support development. This is already installed on the
lab machines and can be found either via the application menus or on the
command line at <code>/opt/idea/2024/bin/idea.sh</code>. This
installation <em>should</em> already have the UoB license enabled, If
however it asks you to provide license details when you first run it,
enter the following as the on-site license server:
<code>http://ls-jetbrains.bris.ac.uk:8080</code></p>
<p>You do not HAVE to install IntelliJ on your own laptop, however many
people choose to do so (in order to work from home). If you plan to use
your own computer for writing code, now is a good time to get IntelliJ
installed. Follow the step-by-step installation instructions that were
provided in the briefing slides for this session (available via GitHub).
For a more detailed walk-through, see the following platform-specific
videos for getting started with IntelliJ on
<a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/608b2c4c-1834-4429-9c86-bf19530c7f3a" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>,
<a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/382a7600-3940-4415-a680-002de6960b99" target="_blank">Windows</a>
and
<a href="https://mediasite.bris.ac.uk/Mediasite/Play/e879f20d3cb44e989202926a64f5be481d" target="_blank">Mac
OSX</a>.</p>

<h3 id="task-3-hello-world">Task 3: Hello World</h3>
<p><a href='03%20Hello%20World/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'>
<img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a>
<a href='03%20Hello%20World/video/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img
src="../../resources/icons/video.png" /> </a></p>
<p>Traditionally, the first program that you write in <em>most</em>
languages is “Hello World”. Take a look at the slides and video above
that describe “Hello World” in Java. Now work through the following step
in order to create and run the “Hello World” program using IntelliJ. If
you already have IntelliJ installed on your laptop, you might like to
follow these steps using your own computer. If not, don’t worry - you
can work through this activity on the lab machines.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a new project in IntelliJ (see screenshot below for suggested
project settings).</li>
<li>Find the <code>java</code> folder in the project view panel (it
should be inside the <code>src/main</code> folder).</li>
<li>Right click on the <code>java</code> folder (<code>control</code>
click on a Mac) to open up the pop-up menu</li>
<li>Select <code>New &gt; Java Class</code> and create a new Java Class
called <code>HelloWorld</code></li>
<li>Copy the code from the above slide and paste it into your new class
(replacing any existing code)</li>
<li>Click on the green <code>Run</code> button on the top-bar menu (or
to the left of the <code>main</code> method)</li>
</ol>
<p>There will be a short delay as IntelliJ compiles and runs your code.
If everything is successful you should see the following output in the
console panel:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World!

Process finished with exit code 0</code></pre>
<p><img src="03%20Hello%20World/images/new-project.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="section-2"></h1>
<h3 id="task-4-template-project">Task 4: Template Project</h3>
<p>Rather than you having to create a new project each time we start a
workbook or assignment, we will often provide you with an existing
template project (in order to help you get started). These templates
will contain all of the rules and dependencies required to build a
project. One of the main benefits is that these projects can be imported
directly into Intellij (or any other IDE for that matter). This will
save us a lot of time installing required libraries and setting up the
build environment.</p>
<p>For the next couple of workbooks, we will be using the
<a href="extras/IntelliJ Template/" target="_blank">shapes</a> template
project. You should copy the entire <code>cw-shapes</code> directory
into your work folder (wherever you want to keep your code for this
unit). In order to open an existing project in IntelliJ, simply click on
the <code>Open</code> button on the IntelliJ startup screen and pick the
<code>cw-shapes</code> folder using the file dialog.</p>
<p>Open the <code>cw-shapes</code> project now and make sure you can run
the code before moving on to the next task. The first time you open a
project, you may find that you have to wait some time before you can run
it - this is due to the need for IntelliJ to download any dependencies
and generate various project setting files (see the progress bar at the
bottom of the window for details). Note that the first time you open the
project you may well need to select a JDK from the list of available
development kits (if you see the
<code>Project JDK is not defined - Setup JDK</code> message when you
open the project).</p>
<h1 id="section-3"></h1>
<h3 id="task-5-command-line">Task 5: Command Line</h3>
<p>During this workbook, we have spent the majority of the time
exploring the use of IntelliJ. At this stage however, it is worth
spending a little bit of time taking a look at how we can build and run
Java projects from the command line. This is important because the
assessed exercises later on in the unit will be marked on the command
line (and you need to make sure that your code will actually build and
run from there).</p>
<p>You may have used <em>GNU Make</em> previously - this software saves
you from having to manually type out all the compile and linking
commands every time you want to build your software. <code>make</code>
takes care of running all the required build commands (as specified in
the <code>Makefile</code>) and intelligently works out what needs to be
done. <code>make</code> however isn’t commonly used for Java development
since building Java projects usually involves much more complicated
activities than just running a set of commands. This is where the
<strong>Maven</strong> build system comes in - it provides various tools
for building and running complex Java projects.</p>
<p>On your command line, change into the project root folder (the
directory where the <code>pom.xml</code> file resides) and type one of
the following commands (depending on your platform):</p>
<pre><code>Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw clean compile
Windows:     mvnw clean compile</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: On some unix systems, you <em>might</em> need
to make <code>mvnw</code> executable first (i.e. by running
<code>chmod u+x mvnw</code>)</p>
<p>The command is doing 2 separate things in sequential order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>clean</code> ensures that everything will be freshly built by
cleaning out (deleting) previously generated files</li>
<li><code>compile</code> compiles and builds all files and resources
(stopping if any build errors are encountered)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you can learn more about these and other build tasks in the
official
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">Maven
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The first time you run the compile command, it might take a while to
complete so be patient. This is because Maven may need to download
various project dependencies. If successful, the output on the command
line should looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 42 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</code></pre>
<p>If you get a <code>BUILD FAILURE</code>, it means the project failed
to complete some of the specified tasks. If this is the case, it would
be wise to go back into IntelliJ and make sure no code issues are
detected there (i.e. no code is highlighted in red and the project can
still be built and run). Fix any problems in IntelliJ and then return to
the command line.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully built your code on the command line, you
can run your program using:</p>
<pre><code>Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw exec:java
Windows:     mvnw exec:java</code></pre>
<p>For a given project, there may be many different things that can be
executed - the above command runs the <code>main</code> method of the
Java part of the project (currently the only thing we have written).</p>
<p>If you are interested in finding out more about Maven, take a look at
<a href="extras/maven.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a> that
describes the of operation of the built tools in more detail.</p>
