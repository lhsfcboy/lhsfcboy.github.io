During this workbook, we have spent the majority of the time exploring the use of IntelliJ.
At this stage however, it is worth spending a little bit of time taking a look at how we can build and run
Java projects from the command line. This is important because the assessed exercises later on in the
unit will be marked on the command line (and you need to make sure that your code will actually build and run from there).

You may have used *GNU Make* previously - this software saves you from having
to manually type out all the compile and linking commands every time you want to build your software.
`make` takes care of running all the required build commands (as specified in the `Makefile`)
and intelligently works out what needs to be done.
`make` however isn't commonly used for Java development since building Java projects
usually involves much more complicated activities than just running a set of commands.
This is where the **Maven** build system comes in - it provides various tools for building and running complex Java projects.

On your command line, change into the project root folder (the directory where the `pom.xml` file resides) and type one of the following commands (depending on your platform):

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw clean compile
    Windows:     mvnw clean compile

**Note**: On some unix systems, you _might_ need to make `mvnw` executable first (i.e. by running `chmod u+x mvnw`)

The command is doing 2 separate things in sequential order:

1. `clean` ensures that everything will be freshly built by cleaning out (deleting) previously generated files
2. `compile` compiles and builds all files and resources (stopping if any build errors are encountered)

Note that you can learn more about these and other build tasks in the official <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">Maven documentation</a>.

The first time you run the compile command, it might take a while to complete so be patient. This is because Maven may need to download various project dependencies. If successful, the output on the command line should looks something like this:

    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Total time: 42 s
    [INFO] Finished at: 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get a `BUILD FAILURE`, it means the project failed to complete some of the specified tasks.
If this is the case, it would be wise to go back into IntelliJ and make sure no code issues are detected there
(i.e. no code is highlighted in red and the project can still be built and run).
Fix any problems in IntelliJ and then return to the command line.

Once you have successfully built your code on the command line, you can run your program using:

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw exec:java
    Windows:     mvnw exec:java

For a given project, there may be many different things that can be executed - the above command runs the `main` method of the Java part of the project (currently the only thing we have written).
