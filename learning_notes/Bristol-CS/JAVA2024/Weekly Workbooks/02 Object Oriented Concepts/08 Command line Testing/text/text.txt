In some situations (e.g. during the coursework marking process) it is useful to be able to run the test cases from the command line
(rather than having to start up IntelliJ). In order to run all of the unit tests present within a Maven project,
change into the project root folder in your command prompt and type:

    Linux/OSX:   ./mvnw clean test
    Windows:     mvnw clean test


If your code passes all of the tests, you should see the following in the Maven output messages:

    [INFO] Tests run: 9, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
    [INFO] 
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------


If on the other hand you fail some tests, the output will look something like the following:

    [ERROR] Tests run: ?, Failures: ?, Errors: ?, Skipped: ?
    [INFO] 
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD FAILURE
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you are able to pass all of the tests before you consider this workbook finished !
