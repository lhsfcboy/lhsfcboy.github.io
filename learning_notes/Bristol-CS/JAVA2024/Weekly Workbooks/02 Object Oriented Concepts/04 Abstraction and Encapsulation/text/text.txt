**Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** are closely linked concepts. Abstraction provides a simplified view of complex objects by only presenting a small number of high-level, easily understandable behaviours and properties. Encapsulation goes one step further by locking away low-level detail and preventing programmers from interfering with the internal operation of objects. View the slides and video linked to above to gain a deeper understanding of these two concepts.

With the knowledge gained from the above, you will now add some elements of internal state to your project. In addition to a number of sides, all shapes also have a colour. Add a new variable to the `TwoDimensionalShape` class that allows the shape's colour to be stored.

To help you in this task, we have provided you with a `Colour` class. The class is already part of the template project and can be found in the `src` folder along with all the other classes. The `Colour` class contains a number of predefined colours, which can be accessed in the following way:

```java
Colour firstColour = Colour.RED;
Colour secondColour = Colour.YELLOW;
Colour thirdColour = Colour.WHITE;
```
Again, there is an optional PRO slide and video linked to at the top of this section which discusses the importance and implications of data hiding through encapsulation.
