# FX Derivatives

## Overview

Derivatives are financial contracts for which prices are derived from assets and instruments with
underlying such as equities, bonds, currencies, precious metals, commodities, interest rates,
credit, benchmarks including indices, non-traditional asset classes, spot, forward contracts,
swaps, options or any combination of the foregoing.

## Futures or Forwards

The difference between a futures and a forward contract are as follows: - (1) Futures contracts are
standardized contracts, with standard terms and trade on exchanges while forwards are tailor-
made to the investor’s preferences and are traded OTC. (2) The investor will face counterparty
risk of the issuer when entering forward contracts as opposed to futures where the exchange
clearinghouse acts as the counterparty, reducing counterparty risk. Swaps are a series of forward
contracts used to exchange specified quantities of assets or cash flows at specified times in the
future. There is a risk that a counterparty may default or not completely fulfil its obligations in
addition to the general risk of settlement default

## Options

### Options Common terminology

- (i) ATM: At-the-money

An option is at-the-money if the strike price is the same as the spot price of the underlying
asset on which the option is written.

- (ii) ITM: In-the-money

A call option is in-the-money when the strike price is below the spot price. A put option is in-
the-money when the strike price is above the spot price.

- (iii) OTM: Out-of-the-money

A call option is out-of-the-money when the strike price is above the spot price of the
underlying asset. A put option is out-of-the-money when the strike price is below the
spot price.
A deep out of the money option is one where the strike price is far from the underlying spot price.
For instance, the call strike is far above the underlying spot price or the put strike is far below the
underlying spot price.
